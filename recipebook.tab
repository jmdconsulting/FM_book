Interface	Built-in, custom layouts, plug-ins	1	Custom Dialogs	The dialog box is used to get information from your user or to get a confirmation of the continuation of a process.       (for example:  "Continue?"  [ok][cancel]Filemaker has a specific method of creating a dialog box for the user.  This is done with a script step called "Show Custom Dialog" and while it's a very powerful and simple tool, it also has some shortcomings.  The built-in Filemaker dialog is limited in ways that may never come up in your usage, but it's likely that eventually you'd find a reason to have more than the 3 available buttons to use in giving your user their choices for the answer to your question.  Another limiting factor arrives when you decide that you want to get input from your user in a field.  The Custom Dialog step provides a place for the user to type in as many as 3 different fields on the dialog box, but if you need more than those 3, you'd need a different solution.The are plugins that will give you, as a developer, plenty of options for ways to create the Custom Dialog, but the most often used solution is a Filemaker layout.  On a layout, you have total control of the content, size, and behavior of the dialog because you have full use of the Filemaker layout interface tools.  This allows for the use of scripted buttons and complete forms full of fields.		Output	The Dymo Printer is everywhere... and from experience, I can tell you that the solution isn't intuitive, but it's also not all that hard to understand.	1	Dymo label Printing			Prefs	USER table for window size, etc	2	User Preferences	Preferences can be stored for a great many things.  We think of using a preferences table when we want a user to give us some values to store, but as a developer, you may want to store some values and this is a fine place to do it.  We discuss this further.		Process	Temp Table (global fields and scripting)	3	Pre-Record-Creation-method			Output	how to send better, and RECEIVE mail	3	email			Interface	Icons and Navigation arrows	10	Graphics			Interface	Static, Dynamic, SQL	10	Value Lists			Technique	SELECT, finding a unrelated value.	10	SQL methods- basic			Process		10	Files and Paths and Insertion of Special files			Output		10	Text Messages - SMS			Input	Vendors or Departments, Excel or EDI, the different ways of working with them.	10	Getting files from others			Interface	We think of the list as just that, but there's a variety of ways to make a list... some more powerful than others.	25	The List (short body part, portals, and virtual)			Interface		50	QuickAdd records - Choosing			Interface		50	Reminders - Notifications - Highlighting			Technique		50	MD5			Technique	More than just faster, performing the script on the server is like working in a vacuum... what you need to make that work.	50	Perform Script on Server			Integration	How to AppleScript and whatever it is Windoze does.	50	Filemaker on the Command-Line			Integration	Rules and Best Practices	50	Credit Cards			Interface	Everything you should know about the business in one screen	99	Dashboards			Technique	Security is one place most people don't spend enough time in learning mode.
